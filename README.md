#  Arrels Locator

## Pitch
Nobody should sleep on the streets, you can help to achieve that.

## Description
Arrels Locator is a mobile app that allows citizens to report people who are sleeping on the streets. At this time there are 3000 homeless people in Barcelona and 900 of them are sleeping on the streets, so they are the most visible part of poverty.
The app serves to share information with Arrels Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps homeless people.
The goal of this app is to use citizenâ€™s participation in order to be aware of the location of homeless people and their situation. With this information Arrels will be able to develop actions to help them.
